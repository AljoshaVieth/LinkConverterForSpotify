    <string name="explanation">This app takes advantage of the fact that in Android it is possible to open links directly with a certain app.\n\nIf you open a Spotify link for the first time after installing this app, you can choose to always open such links in LinkConverterForSpotify.\n (You can also define this in your Android Settings)\n\nFrom now on, every time you open a Spotify link, the corresponding song will open in the AppleMusic or Tidal App.\n\n   And that\'s it.</string>
